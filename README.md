# Notes

A simple application for writing notes.

Create and delete notes. Notes are sorted by last updated date. Edits are automatically saved.

## Getting Started
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `npm run build` to build the client
- Run `npm start` to start the server
- Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser

To run on a different port, specify the port in the start command (e.g. `npm start 9000`)
